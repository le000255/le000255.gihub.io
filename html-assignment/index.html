        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi! My name is Gia Thinh, and I invite you to call me Eddie. I am so
          excited to be a student of Interactive Media Design (IMD) program at
          Algonquin College. This is my 3<sup>rd</sup> year in Canada now. I
          find Ottawa a beautiful city; I am so <em>in love</em> with its
          peaceful atmosphere. The people here are awesome too!
        </p>

        <p>
          Before residing in Canada, I used to be an English teacher; my
          students were kids from three to 12 years old. Oddly enough, something
          happened during my teaching journey which ignited an interest in web
          development and led me to
          <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program as of today.
          You may be curious enough to ask: “How come?” If you do, let’s talk to
          find out.
