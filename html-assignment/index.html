        Hi! My name is Gia Thinh, and I invite you to call me Eddie. I am so
        excited to be a student of Interactive Media Design (IMD) program at
        Algonquin College. This is my 3<sup>rd</sup> year in Canada now. I
        find Ottawa a beautiful city; I am so <em>in love</em> with its
        peaceful atmosphere. The people here are awesome too!
      </p>

      <p>
        Before residing in Canada, I used to be an English teacher; my
        students were kids from three to 12 years old. Oddly enough, something
        happened during my teaching journey which ignited an interest in web
        development and led me to
        <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program as of today.
        You may be curious enough to ask: “How come?” If you do, let’s talk to
        find out.

        I would like to put a list of my hobbies here; it would be wonderful if I have some that match yours so that we
        have more to chat about 😊:
